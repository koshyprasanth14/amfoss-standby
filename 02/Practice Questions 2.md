Practice Questions 2

1. 
Two values of boolean data type are `True` and `False`. They always start with a capital T or F, with the rest of the word in lowercase.

2.
not, and, or are the three boolean operators.

3.
and operator truth table

|expression	|evaluates to:|
|---------------|-------------|
|True and True  |True	      |
|True and False |False	      |
|False and True |False	      |
|False and False|False	      |

or operator truth table

|expression	|evaluates to:|
|---------------|-------------|
|True or True   |True	      |
|True or False  |True	      |
|False or True  |True	      |
|False or False |False	      |

not operator truth table

|expression	|evaluates to:|
|---------------|-------------|
|not True       |False	      |
|not False      |True	      |


4.
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)			- False
not (5 > 4)				- False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)			- True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))		- False
(True and True) and (True == False)	- False
(not False) or (not True)		- True


5.
The 6 comparison operators are:

Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
greater than(>)
lesser than(<)
greater than or equal to(>=)
lesser than or equal to (<=)

6.
equal to assignment operator(=) is used to assign a value to a variable, while the equal to operator(==) is used to check if two given values are equal.

7.
A condition is an expression which evaluates to True or False. A condition is given for decision making. based on our algorithm, the program decides to continue or break a loop or an if else block upon a given condition.

8.
there are three blocks in the given code, the first one is:

if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')


the second one is :
if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')

and the third one is :
else:
        print('ham')

10.
ctrl + c

11.
break causes a program to exit the current loop, while the continue statement causes the program to jump back to the start of the loop.

12.
there arent any changes. in a for loop, the value of the variable given in the syntax will be assigned values starting from the initial value(default is 0), until the final value(must be input by the programmer), and the third value is the step number, that is what the differnce will be between two consecutive values assigned to the variable. 

in the first case, the value of the variable willbe 0-9, and it will remain the same for the other two cases.

14.

i can use:
spam.bacon()
